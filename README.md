A GraphQL client written in PHP which provides very simple, yet powerful, query
generator classes that make the process of interacting with a GraphQL server a
very simple one.

# Usage

There are 3 primary ways to use this package to generate your GraphQL queries:

1. Query Class: Simple class that maps to GraphQL queries. It's designed to
   manipulate queries with ease and speed.
2. QueryBuilder Class: Builder class that can be used to generate `Query`
   objects dynamically. It's design to be used in cases where a query is being
   build in a dynamic fashion.
3. PHP GraphQL-OQM: An extension to this package. It Eliminates the need to
   write any GraphQL queries or refer to the API documentation or syntax. It
   generates query objects from the API schema, declaration exposed through
   GraphQL's introspection, which can then be simply interacted with.

# Installation

Run the following command to install the package using composer:

```
$ composer require gmostafa/php-graphql-client
```

# Object-to-Query-Mapper Extension

To avoid the hassle of having to write _any_ queries and just interact with PHP
objects generated from your API schema visit [PHP GraphQL OQM repository](
https://github.com/mghoneimy/php-graphql-oqm)

# Query Examples

## Simple Query

```
$gql = (new Query('companies'))
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            'name',
            'serialNumber'
        ]
    );
```

This simple query will retrieve all companies displaying their names and serial
numbers.

## Nested Queries
```
$gql = (new Query('companies'))
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            'name',
            'serialNumber',
            (new Query('branches'))
                ->setSelectionSet(
                    [
                        'address',
                        (new Query('contracts'))
                            ->setSelectionSet(['date'])
                    ]
                )
        ]
    );
```

This query is a more complex one, retrieving not just scalar fields, but object
fields as well. This query returns all companies, displaying their names, serial
numbers, and for each company, all its branches, displaying the branch address,
and for each address, it retrieves all contracts bound to this address,
displaying their dates.

## Query With Arguments

```
$gql = (new Query('companies'))
    ->setArguments(['name' => 'Tech Co.', 'first' => 3])
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            'name',
            'serialNumber'
        ]
    );
```

This query does not retrieve all companies by adding arguments. This query will
retrieve the first 3 companies with the name "Tech Co.", displaying their names
and serial numbers.

## Query With Array Argument

```
$gql = (new Query('companies'))
    ->setArguments(['serialNumbers' => [159, 260, 371]])
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            'name',
            'serialNumber'
        ]
    );
```

This query is a special case of the arguments query. In this example, the query
will retrieve only the companies with serial number in one of 159, 260, and 371,
displaying the name and serial number.

## Query With Input Object Argument

```
$gql = (new Query('companies'))
    ->setArguments(['filter' => new RawObject('{name_starts_with: "Face"}')])
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            'name',
            'serialNumber'
        ]
    );
```

This query is another special case of the arguments query. In this example,
we're setting a custom input object "filter" with some values to limit the
companies being returned. We're setting the filter "name_starts_with" with
value "Face".  This query will retrieve only the companies whose names
start with the phrase "Face".

The RawObject class being constructed is used for injecting the string into the
query as it is. Whatever string is input into the RawObject constructor will be
put in the query as it is without any custom formatting normally done by the
query class.

## Query With Variables

```
$gql = (new Query('companies'))
    ->setVariables(
        [
            new Variable('name', 'String', true),
            new Variable('limit', 'Int', false, 5)
        ]
    )
    ->setArguments(['name' => '$name', 'first' => '$limit'])
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            'name',
            'serialNumber'
        ]
    );
```

This query shows how variables can be used in this package to allow for dynamic
requests enabled by GraphQL standards.

### The Variable Class

The Variable class is an immutable class that represents a variable in GraphQL
standards. Its constructor receives 4 arguments:

- name: Represents the variable name
- type: Represents the variable type according to the GraphQL server schema
- isRequired (Optional): Represents if the variable is required or not, it's
false by default
- defaultValue (Optional): Represents the default value to be assigned to the
variable. The default value will only be considered
if the isRequired argument is set to false.

## Using Interfaces: Query With Inline Fragments

When querying a field that returns an interface type, you might need to use
inline fragments to access data on the underlying concrete type.

This example show how to generate inline fragments using this package:

```
$gql = new Query('companies');
$gql->setSelectionSet(
    [
        'serialNumber',
        'name',
        (new InlineFragment('PrivateCompany'))
            ->setSelectionSet(
                [
                    'boardMembers',
                    'shareholders',
                ]
            ),
    ]
);
```

# The Query Builder

The QueryBuilder class can be used to construct Query objects dynamically, which
can be useful in some cases. It works very similarly to the Query class, but the
Query building is divided into steps.

That's how the "Query With Input Object Argument" example can be created using
the QueryBuilder:

```
$builder = (new QueryBuilder('companies'))
    ->setVariable('namePrefix', 'String', true)
    ->setArgument('filter', new RawObject('{name_starts_with: $namePrefix}'))
    ->selectField('name')
    ->selectField('serialNumber');
$gql = $builder->getQuery();
```

# Constructing The Client

A Client object can easily be instantiated by providing the GraphQL endpoint
URL. The Client constructor also receives an optional "httpOptions"
array, which can be used to add authorization headers to all requests being sent
to the GraphQL server.

Example:

```
$client = new Client(
    'http://api.graphql.com',
    [ 
        'headers' => ['Authorization' => 'Basic xyz']
    ]
);
```

# Running Queries

## Result Formatting

Running query with the GraphQL client and getting the results in object
structure:

```
$results = $client->runQuery($gql);
$results->getData()->Company[0]->branches;
```
Or getting results in array structure:

```
$results = $client->runQuery($gql, true);
$results->getData()['Company'][1]['branches']['address']
```

## Passing Variables to Queries

Running queries containing variables requires passing an associative array which
maps variable names (keys) to variable values (values) to the `runQuery` method.
Here's an example:

```
$gql = (new Query('companies'))
    ->setVariables(
        [
            new Variable('name', 'String', true),
            new Variable('limit', 'Int', false, 5)
        ]
    )
    ->setArguments(['name' => '$name', 'first' => '$limit'])
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            'name',
            'serialNumber'
        ]
    );
$variablesArray = ['name' => 'Tech Co.', 'first' => 5];
$results = $client->runQuery($gql, true, $variablesArray);
```

# Mutations

Mutations follow the same rules of queries in GraphQL, they select fields on
returned objects, receive arguments, and can have sub-fields.

Here's a sample example on how to construct and run mutations:

```
$mutation = (new Mutation('createCompany'))
    ->setArguments(['companyObject' => new RawObject('{name: "Trial Company", employees: 200}')])
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            '_id',
            'name',
            'serialNumber',
        ]
    );
$results = $client->runQuery($mutation);
```

Mutations can be run by the client the same way queries are run.

## Mutations With Variables Example

Mutations can utilize the variables in the same way Queries can. Here's an
example on how to use the variables to pass input objects to the GraphQL server
dynamically:

```
$mutation = (new Mutation('createCompany'))
    ->setVariables([new Variable('company', 'CompanyInputObject', true)])
    ->setArguments(['companyObject' => '$company']);

$variables = ['company' => ['name' => 'Tech Company', 'type' => 'Testing', 'size' => 'Medium']];
$client->runQuery(
    $mutation, true, $variables
);
```

These are the resulting mutation and the variables passed with it:

```
mutation($company: CompanyInputObject!) {
  createCompany(companyObject: $company)
}
{"company":{"name":"Tech Company","type":"Testing","size":"Medium"}}
```

# Live API Example

GraphQL Pokemon is a very cool public GraphQL API available to retrieve Pokemon
data. The API is available publicly on the web, we'll use it to demo the
capabilities of this client.

Github Repo link: https://github.com/lucasbento/graphql-pokemon

API link: https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/

This query retrieves any pokemon's evolutions and their attacks:

```
query($name: String!) {
  pokemon(name: $name) {
    id
    number
    name
    evolutions {
      id
      number
      name
      weight {
        minimum
        maximum
      }
      attacks {
        fast {
          name
          type
          damage
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

That's how this query can be written using the query class and run using the
client:

```
$client = new Client(
    'https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/'
);
$gql = (new Query('pokemon'))
    ->setVariables([new Variable('name', 'String', true)])
    ->setArguments(['name' => '$name'])
    ->setSelectionSet(
        [
            'id',
            'number',
            'name',
            (new Query('evolutions'))
                ->setSelectionSet(
                    [
                        'id',
                        'number',
                        'name',
                        (new Query('attacks'))
                            ->setSelectionSet(
                                [
                                    (new Query('fast'))
                                        ->setSelectionSet(
                                            [
                                                'name',
                                                'type',
                                                'damage',
                                            ]
                                        )
                                ]
                            )
                    ]
                )
        ]
    );
try {
    $name = readline('Enter pokemon name: ');
    $results = $client->runQuery($gql, true, ['name' => $name]);
}
catch (QueryError $exception) {
    print_r($exception->getErrorDetails());
    exit;
}
print_r($results->getData()['pokemon']);
```

Or alternatively, That's how this query can be generated using the QueryBuilder
class:

```
$client = new Client(
    'https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/'
);
$builder = (new QueryBuilder('pokemon'))
    ->setVariable('name', 'String', true)
    ->setArgument('name', '$name')
    ->selectField('id')
    ->selectField('number')
    ->selectField('name')
    ->selectField(
        (new QueryBuilder('evolutions'))
            ->selectField('id')
            ->selectField('name')
            ->selectField('number')
            ->selectField(
                (new QueryBuilder('attacks'))
                    ->selectField(
                        (new QueryBuilder('fast'))
                            ->selectField('name')
                            ->selectField('type')
                            ->selectField('damage')
                    )
            )
    );
try {
    $name = readline('Enter pokemon name: ');
    $results = $client->runQuery($builder, true, ['name' => $name]);
}
catch (QueryError $exception) {
    print_r($exception->getErrorDetails());
    exit;
}
print_r($results->getData()['pokemon']);
```

# Running Raw Queries

Although not the primary goal of this package, but it supports running raw
string queries, just like any other client using the `runRawQuery` method in the
`Client` class. Here's an example on how to use it:

```
$gql = <<<QUERY
query {
    pokemon(name: "Pikachu") {
        id
        number
        name
        attacks {
            special {
                name
                type
                damage
            }
        }
    }
}
QUERY;

$results = $client->runQuery($gql);
```
